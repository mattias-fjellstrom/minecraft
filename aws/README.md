# AWS

## Prerequisites

For all AWS samples, you must have the AWS CLI installed ([instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)) and you must set up access keys on your local machine ([instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)).

The access key you use should preferably have an admin IAM policy (i.e. `*:*`), to avoid any permission issues.
